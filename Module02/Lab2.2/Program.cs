/*
 * Lab 2.2 - ASCII Art
 * The following is a piece of visual art using common characters.
 * There is a certain amount of parity between what you see on the screen and what is printed to the console.
 * You may notice lines that include a '\' have two of them.
 * This is because '\' is a reserved character in our language.
 * Specifically it is an escape character, which changes how a character in a string is interpreted.
 * In this case, a single \ would be interpreted as escaping the next character.
 * With the \\ we are telling the string that \ is to be interpreted literally.
